## React Nft Challenge.

''In this application we build a modern Cryptopunk clone with React Js & Web 3.0.''<br>
The address as well as the punks are displayed dynamicaly straight from Opensea.

In depth we are..

- Using Thirdweb to build the backend of our Ethereum-based app.

- Using React JS to build the frontend while we estabilish connection with our NFT collection on OpenSea.

The scripts will be upgrading occasionally with new features added. Stay tuned!!
