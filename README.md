## React Nft Challenge.

In this application we build a modern Cryptopunk clone with React Js & Web 3.0.<br>

The address as well as the punks are displayed dynamicaly from **Opensea Marketplace**.

Stack used:

- Thirdweb to build the **backend** of our Ethereum-based app.

- React JS to build the **frontend**.

The scripts will be upgrading occasionally with new features added. Stay tuned!!
